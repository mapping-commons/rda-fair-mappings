      label: The title of your case study
      description: A short but descriptive title that describes your case study.

  - type: textarea
    id: case-summary
    attributes:
      label: Summary
      description: A high-level summary of the case study. This should be sufficient for a general data practitioner to get a good sense of what the mapping case study is all about, without being overly detailed (3-5 sentences).
    validations:
      required: true      
  - type: input
    id: case-domain
    attributes:
      label: Domain
      description: "Which scientific/activity domain do the mappings apply to? For example: Medical Domain; Materials; Humanities."

      description: General use case for the mapping.
      multiple: true
      options:
        - Semantic interoperability (shared understanding of data across multiple systems)
        - Discovery (finding related data across resources)
        - Integration (Connecting data across disparate resources)
        - Transformation (translating source data into a target schema)
        - Analysis (Aggregating data and driving new insights)
        - Other (My general use case is something not well reflected by the above)

    attributes:
      label: Purpose of the mapping
      description: |
        Use this field to describe the purpose of your mapping. This can include for example the reason why the mapping needed from the end-user's perspection (e.g. discovering and aggregating data across multiple disparate resources) or it can be a more practical description related to the mapping task (e.g. mapping data from one schema to another as part of an automated ETL system). You can use, for example, the user story format to describe the purpose from perspective of different stakeholders (See [Mondo case](https://mapping-commons.github.io/rda-fair-mappings/case-study/case-study-mondo/#purpose) for an example).
    validations:
      required: false       
  - type: textarea
    id: case-mapped-resources
    attributes:
      label: Type of mapped resources
      description: "What kind of things are being mapped? Examples: database and/or database schema, ontology, API, SPARQL endpoint, knowledge graph, etc. Give sufficient detail for a general data practitioner to understand, and ideally a link to an example resource that is being mapped."
    validations:
      required: true      
  - type: textarea
    id: case-links
    attributes:
      label: Links to an existing mappings
      description: Links to resources that represent the actual mappings. Can be for example a service, api, code or a document (e.g., a SSSOM file). 
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: textarea
    id: case-tools
    attributes:
      label: Tools used for creating the mapping
      description: "For example, this can be tools used for automated matching (such as LogMap in the context of ontologies), or tools used for the manual curation of mappings (such as Google sheets, or more specialised software such as [Cocoda](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda))."
    validations:
      required: true       
  - type: textarea
    id: case-mapping-relations
    attributes:
      label: Type of mapping relations
      description: "Mapping relations in this context are the types of correspondences between a source and a target you care about, e.g., data transformation functions (incl, e.g. unit conversion), shared extension/referent, entity mappings (such as skos:exactMatch), one to many, many to one, complex expression matching (e.g. across medical ontologies)."
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: textarea
    id: case-implemenation-samples
    attributes:
      label: Examples (samples) of different types of mapping implementations 
      description: "E.g. using pseudo-code, code-snippets, graph-based representation (nodes and edges), examples of source and target documents for transformations, SSSOM files, etc."

      required: true

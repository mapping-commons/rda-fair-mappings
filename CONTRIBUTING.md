# Contributing to the **RDA FAIR Mapping Working Group**

We welcome **all** contributions ‚Äî from typo fixes to new case studies.  
This short guide explains the preferred workflow for each contribution type.  
If something is unclear, open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/mapping-commons/rda-fair-mappings/discussions) for general question answering (QA) or
an [issue](https://github.com/mapping-commons/rda-fair-mappings/issues) for a specific report or request and we will help.

## 1  Contributing a *new* case study

> **Goal**: add a _real-world, already implemented_ FAIR Mapping example (data, schema, ontology, workflow).

Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mapping-commons/rda-fair-mappings/issues) and select the "FAIR Mappings Case Study submission" template.
Fill in the details, then submit the issue.

**Note**: we are looking for case study descriptions that are sufficiently detailed to be useful for others, but not so detailed that they become overwhelming.
Aim for a balance that provides enough context without excessive complexity.
Ideally the description should be self-contained, without the need for a reader to "click on things" to find information essential to understanding the case study.

## 2  Revising a case study

If you go to the page of the case study you seek to edit, you should see a grey pen in the top right corner of the page, right next to the case study title.
Clicking on the pen opens the case study in edit mode on GitHub.
After you have finished your edits, please click on "Commit changes" and open a Pull Request. That is it!

### 2.1 Updating **your own** case study

We consider the original author of the case study the final authority on how the case study is presented.
Therefore, we will not request additional reviews from the community when you seek to update your own case study.

### 2.2 Revising **someone else‚Äôs** study

If you seek to update someone else's case study, we will request a review from the case studies original author before merging.
Note that this may sometimes take a while.

## 3  Working with GitHub Discussions

- **Start a discussion** under the [*Discussions* tab](https://github.com/mapping-commons/rda-fair-mappings/discussions), choosing the most relevant category (e.g. *FAIR Impact Mapping Recommendations*, *Mapping Taxonomy*).
- Try to focus your own discussions on a single topic or question.
- When consensus emerges, summarise in the top post (editable) and, if appropriate, open a PR to update docs.

## 4  SOP for making decisions üó≥Ô∏è

1. Any member may propose a motion in a PR or Discussion.
2. Label the thread **`decision-proposal`** and ping `@mapping-commons/rda-fair-mappings`.
3. After **4 business days** of discussion, call for a vote. Use the following emoticons to cast your vote:
   - üëç  = **Yes** / accept
   - üëé = **No** / reject
   - üòï = Need more info
4. Simple majority of üëç vs üëé decides. Tie ‚Üí escalate to chair meeting.
5. Record the outcome in the thread using a screenshort of the vote (otherwise it can change after the vote is called!) and, if accepted, merge the PR.

## 5  Fixing typos or small errors

- Use the **‚úèÔ∏è‚ÄØEdit** button on GitHub or from the website and open a PR.  
- No need to open an issue first for obvious fixes (spelling, broken link).

## 6  Proposing edits to the website

The website is built from Markdown in **`src/docs/`** via GitHub Pages.

1. Edit the relevant `.md` file or create a new one.
2. To add a page to the navbar, update [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/mapping-commons/rda-fair-mappings/blob/main/mkdocs.yml)
3. Open a PR; the GitHub Pages preview will show a live link.

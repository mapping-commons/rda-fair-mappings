Example of semantic transformations.</p> <p>Lets assume that we have instances of the <code>Structure</code> and <code>CalcResults</code> datamodels (named <code>C3H6</code> and <code>C3H6_result</code> in the figure). Given that it is possible to ask a semantic system to instantiate an instance of the <code>Molecule</code> datamodel. If the system can find a route from the properties of the <code>Molecule</code> datamodel, via the mappings and mapping functions, to existing data, it will be able to return a <code>Molecule</code> instance.</p> <p>This is a very powerful use of semantic mappings that enables seamless data integration. It allows independent data providers document their datasets by creating datamodels for them and map them to ontologies. An data consumer can then document what data he/she needs by creating a datamodel for that and map it to the ontologies. With support from an ontologist that may provide generic mapping functions enabling generic transformations between individuals of different ontological concepts, the data consumer is then able to get a selection of the available data represented in the form he/she needs it in.

The FAIR Mappings WG builds upon and extends beyond Europe the work done in two EOSC-related projects in Europe: 1) FAIR-IMPACT that develops recommendations for creating, documenting and sharing semantic artefact crosswalks and mappings; and 2) FAIRCORE4EOSC that develops the MSCR tool to register mappings.</p> <p>The expected outputs of the FAIR Mappings WG include:</p> <ul> <li>A set of technical recommendations to enable the creation of FAIR-by-design mappings and support the FAIRification of existing mappings;</li> <li>A methodology and practical framework covering the different steps of mapping life cycle to support communities undertaking mappings;</li> <li>A collection of hamonised use case descriptions which support the identification of various types of mappings;</li> <li>A classification of mappings describing the various types of mappings as well as the mapping process;</li> <li>A set of data models and the associated metadata for sharing the different types of mappings and mappings related operations as captures by the classification of mappings;</li> <li>A Knowledge Base which brings together all the above-mentioned outputs and show-cases mapping scenarios with associated data models and links to the mappings classification.</li> </ul> <p>To achieve the above, the Working Group follows three phases of work:</p> <p></p> <p>Please note that timeline has shifted; the Working Group started its work in February 2025 and runs until August 2026.  </p> <p>We invite everyone interested in the FAIR Mappings WG to join the working group or contribute a case study.</p> <ul> <li>Use cases and case studies</li> <li>How to contribute?</li> <li>FAIR Mappings WG Activity</li> <li>Statement of Work</li> <li>Member list</li> <li>FAIR Mappings WG Slack Channel (please request access on the issue tracker).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"decision-log/","title":"Decision log of the Working Group","text":""},{"location":"decision-log/#decisions-made-by-the-fair-mappings-wg","title":"Decisions made by the FAIR Mappings WG","text":""},{"location":"decision-log/#monday-17-february-2025","title":"Monday 17 February 2025","text":"<ul> <li>Separate case studies (specific descriptions for mapping scenarios of a specific user) from use cases (abstract descriptions of ways in which mappings are used).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"recommendation/","title":"FAIR Mapping Recommendations","text":"<p>FAIR Mapping recommendations were created as part of the the FAIR-IMPACT project (2022-2025).

The recommendations were formulated based on brainstorming sessions focusing on each part using gathered community requirements and feedback collected during various events. The recommendations are broken down as \u201cgeneric recommendations\u201d and \u201ctechnical recommendations\u201d.

Given that it is possible to ask a semantic system to instantiate an instance of the <code>Molecule</code> datamodel. If the system can find a route from the properties of the <code>Molecule</code> datamodel, via the mappings and mapping functions, to existing data, it will be able to return a <code>Molecule</code> instance.</p> <p>This is a very powerful use of semantic mappings that enables seamless data integration. It allows independent data providers document their datasets by creating datamodels for them and map them to ontologies. An data consumer can then document what data he/she needs by creating a datamodel for that and map it to the ontologies. With support from an ontologist that may provide generic mapping functions enabling generic transformations between individuals of different ontological concepts, the data consumer is then able to get a selection of the available data represented in the form he/she needs it in.
